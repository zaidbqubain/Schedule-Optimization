# Schedule-Optimization

This website is an algorithm-enabled tool designed to assist students with work planning and general scheduling.  The platform outputs a schedule of times to work on specific assignments based on their priority and student-specific preferences.  This schedule serves as an alternative time management toolthat each student can use to plan their required work.  The provided schedule allows students to focus on their studies instead of creating a daily study plan.  In addition to the student focus, this platform provides insights for each department such as a machine-learning powered tool that creates a list of high-performing students that are more likely to succeed in a teaching assistant role or summer opportunity.
