# Schedule-Optimization

The TimeTracker platform is an algorithm-enabled tool designed to assist students with work planningand general scheduling.  The platform outputs a schedule of times to work on specific assignments based ontheir priority and student-specific preferences.  This schedule serves as an alternative time management toolthat each student can use to plan their required work.  The provided schedule allows students to focus ontheir studies instead of creating a daily study plan.  In addition to the student focus, TimeTracker providesinsights for each department such as a machine-learning powered tool that creates a list of high-performingstudents that are more likely to succeed in a teaching assistant role or summer opportunity.
